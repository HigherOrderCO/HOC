## About us

What is the true nature of computation? Historically, the Turing Machine and the Lambda Calculus have been the pillars of computational theory, shaping our understanding and practice of programming. Despite their equivalence in terms of computation, as established by the Church-Turing thesis, practical challenges in performance, security, and parallelism have revealed their inherent limitations. A significant evolution from these limitations is seen in a new model of computation, Interaction Combinators, developed by Yves Lafont, which deconstructs computation into two truly atomic operations - commutation and annihilation, leading to enhanced efficiency, security, and inherent parallelism. At Higher Order Company, our singular mission is to harness the potential of Interaction Nets, thereby aiming to make computing languages, runtimes, and hardware faster and more efficient for everyone.
