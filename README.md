## About us

Higher Order Company (HOC) is a pioneering enterprise dedicated to advancing humanity's technological capabilities through functional programming and cutting-edge research in type theory and proof assistants. Our unique selling point is that we are pioneers in the field of functional programming and research in type theory and proof assistants. Our core innovations, the Higher-order Virtual Machine (HVM) and Kind2, are revolutionizing the field of computation.

HVM is a pure functional, lazy, non-garbage-collected, and massively parallel runtime, leveraging the Interaction Net model to outperform traditional alternatives in higher-order computations. 

Kind2, built upon HVM, offers unprecedented speed and efficiency in type-checking and program execution, making it the perfect tool for developers seeking to optimize their code.

At HOC, our mission is to refine and develop these groundbreaking technologies, creating products and applications that drive humanity's technological progress into the parallel, functional future of computing.
